## Introduction

AllergySavvy is an innovative app aimed at individuals with food allergies. It leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze user data and provide tailored recipes that exclude allergens. This repository contains the machine learning models, data processing scripts, and other development resources for AllergySavvy.

## Features

- **Allergy Detection**: Machine learning models to detect potential allergens in user data.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Algorithms that suggest recipes based on user preferences and dietary restrictions.
- **Data Processing**: Scripts for cleaning and preprocessing data.
- **Model Training**: Jupyter notebooks and scripts for training and evaluating models.

## Installation

To get started with the development environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/AllergySavvy/ML-AllergySavvy-Dev.git
  cd ML-AllergySavvy-Dev
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt


##Usage

After setting up the development environment, you can start using the scripts and notebooks in the repository:

    Data Processing: Use the scripts in the data_processing directory to clean and preprocess your data.
    Model Training: Use the notebooks in the notebooks directory to train and evaluate machine learning models.
    Prediction: Use the scripts in the prediction directory to make predictions using the trained models.
